# Serves http://<host>:1420 — first boot shows the media-server login, where
# you pick Jellyfin or Plex (append ?demo=1 for the synthetic demo library, no
# server needed; ?backend=plex to preselect Plex). This runs the
# project's documented server runtime (`npm run serve`: vite preview plus the
# middleware in vite.config.ts), so the Jellyseerr/Romm integration proxy,
# F8 feedback pins and the whole Remote Play stack work — including private
# instances: open /remote.html on a phone or set-top box and the CONTAINER
# renders the store and streams it over WebRTC (use host networking for
# that; see docker-compose.yml). The one host-side feature that stays off
# is local mpv playback, which only ever applies on the HTPC itself.
